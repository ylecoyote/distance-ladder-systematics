## TIER 1: BLOCKING ISSUES (Must fix before submission)

### ✅ Issue #1: Δμ to ΔH₀ Conversion Error [FIXED]

**Problem**: Line 355 incorrectly converted Δμ = -0.024 mag → ΔH₀ = 3.7 km/s/Mpc
**Correct**: Δμ = -0.024 mag → ΔH₀ = 0.75 km/s/Mpc (factor 5x error!)

**Fix Applied** (Commit 91723af):
```latex
% Before (INCORRECT):
corresponding to Cepheid H₀ being ~3.7 km/s/Mpc higher.

% After (CORRECT):
corresponding to a ~1.1% increase in Cepheid H₀, i.e.,
~0.75 km/s/Mpc higher at H₀ ≈ 68-70 km/s/Mpc.
```

**Calculation**:
```
H₀ ∝ 10^(-0.2μ)
ΔH₀/H₀ = -0.2 ln(10) × Δμ = -0.4605 × (-0.024) = +0.011 = +1.1%
At H₀ ≈ 70: ΔH₀ = 0.77 ≈ 0.75 km/s/Mpc ✓
```

**Impact**: Critical for credibility; does not affect main conclusions

---

### ✅ Issue #2: Table 2 σ_total Value [VERIFIED CORRECT]

**Reviewer claim**: "Table 2 reports Stage-5 σ_total = 2.43"
**Our verification**: Table shows 2.58 (CORRECT)
**Calculation check**: √(0.80² + 2.45²) = √6.64 = 2.577 ≈ 2.58 ✓

**Conclusion**: Reviewer may have seen older draft; no fix needed

---

### ✅ Issue #3: Placeholder Figures [ALL GENERATED]

**Problem**: Figures 1, 4, 5 were 6-7 KB placeholders (800×600, grayscale)

#### Before Fix:
```bash
figure1_tension_evolution.png: 6.7 KB (placeholder)
figure4_h0_compilation.png:    6.8 KB (placeholder)
figure5_h6_fit.png:            6.6 KB (placeholder)
```

#### After Fix (Commit 7aa87cf):
```bash
figure1_tension_evolution.png: 217 KB (real, 300 DPI)
figure4_h0_compilation.png:    204 KB (real, 300 DPI)
figure5_h6_fit.png:            354 KB (real, 300 DPI)
```

### Figure 1: Tension Evolution (217 KB)
**Script**: `analysis/create_figure1_tension_evolution.py` (404 lines)

**Features**:
- Progressive H₀ reduction: 73.17 → 70.17 km/s/Mpc through 5 stages
- Stage 5B conservative scenario: 73.17 ± 2.58 → 2.2σ tension
- Planck horizontal band (67.36 ± 0.54)
- 3σ threshold line
- Tension values labeled on each stage (6.0σ → 1.1σ)

### Figure 4: H₀ Compilation Forest Plot (204 KB)
**Script**: `analysis/create_figure4_h0_compilation.py` (348 lines)

**Features**:
- Five H₀ measurements with error bars:
  - Planck CMB: 67.36 ± 0.54 (blue)
  - JAGB: 67.96 ± 2.65 (green)
  - Cosmic Chronometers: 68.33 ± 1.57 (green)
  - TRGB: 69.85 ± 2.33 (orange)
  - SH0ES Cepheid: 73.17 ± 1.31 (red, highlighted)
- Convergence band: 67.48 ± 0.50 km/s/Mpc
- 3σ threshold lines
- Orange circle highlights Cepheid (shares systematics)

### Figure 5: H(z) Fit with χ²_red Analysis (354 KB)
**Script**: `analysis/create_figure5_hz_fit_intrinsic_scatter.py` (521 lines)

**Addresses Issue #5**: χ²_red = 0.47 (well below 1)

**Analysis**:
- **Original fit**: H₀ = 68.33 ± 1.57 km/s/Mpc, χ²_red = 0.47
- **Scaled fit**: H₀ = 68.33 ± 1.07 km/s/Mpc, χ²_red = 1.00
- **Error scale factor**: 0.685 (reduces errors by 1.46×)
- **Central value**: UNCHANGED
- **Interpretation**: Reported H(z) errors conservative by factor 1.46

**Figure panels**:
1. H(z) data with original (dashed red) and scaled (solid green) fits
2. Residuals for original fit (shows χ²_red < 1 pattern)
3. Residuals for scaled fit (shows χ²_red = 1 pattern)

**Key Finding**: Convergence at H₀ ≈ 68.3 km/s/Mpc robust to error treatment

---

## TIER 2: MAJOR ISSUES (Significantly strengthen manuscript)

### ✅ Issue #4: Systematic Count Mismatch [FIXED]

**Problem**: Text claimed "11 systematic sources" but Equation 6 sums only 10 terms

**Root cause**: "Sample selection" listed as item #6 but not in equation

**Solution** (Commit 5a6a3cb): Consolidate sample selection into "Other systematics"

**Changes**:
1. Changed "11 primary systematic error sources" → "10"
2. Added: "Minor systematics such as sample selection effects..."
3. Removed standalone "Sample selection" from enumeration
4. Updated "Other systematics" description:
   ```latex
   Residual effects including phase coverage, template fitting,
   outlier rejection, and sample selection biases (magnitude limits,
   period cuts, detection thresholds). These subdominant systematics
   each contribute <0.3 km/s/Mpc individually and are consolidated
   into a single 0.5 km/s/Mpc quadrature component.
   ```
5. Updated Equation sum: Σ(i=1 to 11) → Σ(i=1 to 10)
6. Updated all text references from 11 → 10

**Impact**:
- Equation 6 unchanged: Still 10 terms, still 2.45 km/s/Mpc
- No recalculation needed
- Text now consistent with equations
- Addresses reviewer's counting discrepancy

### ⚠️ Issue #5: Cosmic Chronometer χ²_red < 1 [ADDRESSED IN FIGURE 5]

**Problem**: χ²_red = 0.47 suggests over-estimated errors, affects H₀ uncertainty

**Resolution**: Figure 5 generation (see Issue #3) includes full χ²_red analysis

**Key Points**:
- Over-estimated errors → scale down by √(χ²_red) to achieve χ²_red = 1
- Central H₀ = 68.33 km/s/Mpc **UNCHANGED**
- Uncertainty: 1.57 → 1.07 km/s/Mpc (tighter constraint)
- Convergence with JAGB (67.96) and Planck (67.36) **ROBUST**

**Reviewer concern addressed**:
> "That matters because your 1.57 km/s/Mpc uncertainty informs the three-method convergence."

✓ Demonstrated convergence robust to error treatment
✓ Tighter H₀ constraint strengthens convergence argument
✓ Manuscript can report both original (conservative) and scaled (realistic) values

### ✅ Issue #6: Three-Method Convergence Planck-Dominated [ADDRESSED]

**Problem**: Weighted mean H₀ = 67.48 ± 0.50 dominated by Planck (weight = 86.2%)

**Reviewer's request**:
> "Please add (i) a leave-one-out exercise, (ii) an equal-weights mean"

**Solution** (Commit 4940cf3): Comprehensive LOO analysis

**Script**: `analysis/leave_one_out_convergence.py` (340 lines)

#### Results:

**Full Three-Method Weighted Mean**:
- H₀ = 67.48 ± 0.50 km/s/Mpc
- Weights: Planck 86.2%, Chronometers 10.2%, JAGB 3.6%

**Leave-One-Out Results**:
1. Excluding JAGB: H₀ = 67.46 ± 0.51 (shift: -0.02 km/s/Mpc)
2. Excluding Chronometers: H₀ = 67.38 ± 0.53 (shift: -0.10 km/s/Mpc)
3. **Excluding Planck**: H₀ = 68.23 ± 1.35 (shift: +0.75 km/s/Mpc) ← **KEY**

**Equal-Weights Mean**:
- H₀ = 67.88 ± 0.28 km/s/Mpc (SEM)
- Shift from weighted: +0.40 km/s/Mpc

#### Critical Finding:

**Without Planck**: JAGB + Chronometers alone → H₀ = 68.23 ± 1.35 km/s/Mpc

→ Convergence at ~67-68 km/s/Mpc holds **WITHOUT CMB constraint**
→ Demonstrates convergence is **NOT** an artifact of Planck dominance

#### Robustness Assessment:

✓ All LOO means within 1.5σ of full mean
✓ Maximum shift: 0.75 km/s/Mpc (Planck exclusion)
✓ LOO spread: 0.85 km/s/Mpc (consistent with 0.97 original)
✓ Equal-weights mean: 67.88 km/s/Mpc (agrees within uncertainty)

#### Interpretation:

- Planck dominates **weighting** BUT doesn't determine **central value**
- JAGB (67.96) + Chronometers (68.33) **bracket** Planck (67.36)
- All three methods independently favor H₀ ~ 67-68 km/s/Mpc
- Convergence is **ROBUST** to method exclusion and weighting scheme

**Main conclusion STRENGTHENED**: Independent measurements consistently favor lower H₀

### ⚠️ Issue #7: Incomplete Citations [PENDING]

**Missing/Incomplete**:
1. **Parallax offset**: "~0.017 mas beyond EDR3 corrections" → Which paper?
2. **Broken P-L**: "p < 10⁻³ significance" → Which analysis?
3. **Anderson et al. 2024**: Listed as "arXiv 2412.xxxxx" (placeholder)
4. **Freedman et al. 2025**: May need pagination update

**Required**:
- Replace all placeholder citations
- Add complete derivation path for each systematic
- Consider adding Appendix with calculations

**Priority**: MODERATE (required for acceptance, not blocking)
**Estimated time**: 1-2 hours

---

### ⚠️ Issue #8: Covariance Matrix Not Documented [PENDING]

**Problem**: §3.1 mentions 4×4 correlation matrix with ρ ∈ [0.3, 0.5] but doesn't show it

**Reviewer's request**:
> "Please show the actual matrix, rationale for ρ values, and post the code + random seed."

**What's Needed**:
1. Display the 4×4 matrix explicitly:
   ```
   ⎡ 1.0  0.5  0.4  0.3 ⎤  Crowding direct
   ⎢ 0.5  1.0  0.4  0.3 ⎥  Crowding covariant
   ⎢ 0.4  0.4  1.0  0.3 ⎥  Extinction
   ⎣ 0.3  0.3  0.3  1.0 ⎦  Metallicity
   ```

2. Justify ρ values with physical reasoning
3. Provide Python code with random seed for reproducibility
4. Show full posterior distribution from MC sampling

**Priority**: MODERATE (improves transparency)
**Estimated time**: 1 hour
