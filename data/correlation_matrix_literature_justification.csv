Period_Distribution_Metallicity,0.3,"Both depend on stellar evolution physics; metal-rich stars have different P-L relations","Freedman & Madore (2011, 2020); Monson et al. (2012); Scowcroft et al. (2016)","Stellar evolution: metallicity affects envelope structure and pulsation properties; period distribution reflects population age and chemical enrichment"
Metallicity_Crowding,0.2,"Crowding affects color measurements which propagate to metallicity estimates via extinction corrections","Anderson et al. (2016); Riess et al. (2016); Scolnic et al. (2015)","Observational: blended stars bias photometric colors → reddening inference → metallicity determination through dust-chemistry coupling"
Metallicity_Extinction,0.3,"Extinction corrections depend on assumed metallicity through R_V and extinction curve shape; dust and metals share ISM origin","Gieren et al. (2005); Madore et al. (2009); Freedman (2021)","ISM physics: metal-rich environments have different dust properties and extinction laws; metallicity gradients correlate with dust column density"

Photometric_Extinction,0.2,"Both depend on accurate multi-band photometric calibration; extinction derived from color indices","Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011); Scolnic et al. (2015); HST calibration papers","Measurement coupling: photometric zero-point errors propagate to all color measurements and extinction estimates; systematic calibration offsets affect both directly"

(1999); Brout & Scolnic (2021); Pantheon+","Observational: extinction corrections for Cepheid anchors and SNe in same hosts share dust modeling assumptions; weak correlation due to different wavelength dependence"
