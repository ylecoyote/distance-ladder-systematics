# Phase 3: Crowding Systematic Analysis

**Project:** Distance Ladder Systematics Investigation
**Phase:** 3 - Crowding Systematic Deep Dive
**Date:** October 21, 2025
**Lead Investigator:** The Debugger
**Critical Review:** The Skeptic
**Strategic Oversight:** Dr. Chen

## Executive Summary

**The Crowding Controversy:**

Two contradictory positions emerged from our investigation:

**SH0ES Position (Riess et al. 2024):**
- JWST observations validate HST Cepheid photometry
- HST vs JWST: -0.01 ± 0.03 mag difference (negligible)
- "Reject crowding as explanation for Hubble Tension at 8.2σ confidence"
- **Conclusion:** Crowding is NOT the problem

**CCHP Position (Freedman et al. 2025):**
- Crowding corrections are "not small"
- Covariant error chain: crowding → colors → dust → metallicity
- "Could have a much bigger effect than just saying crowding is not a problem"
- Did NOT apply crowding corrections, incorporated as systematic uncertainty
- **Cepheid σ_sys = 3.10 km/s/Mpc** (vs TRGB/JAGB ~1.5-1.9 km/s/Mpc)

**The Skeptic's Assessment:**

These positions are NOT contradictory when properly understood:
- SH0ES shows HST and JWST **agree on average** (-0.01 mag)
- This rules out crowding as systematic **bias** (offset)
- But DOESN'T rule out crowding as source of **scatter/uncertainty**
- Freedman's point: Crowding uncertainty propagates through covariant chain → amplifies

**Critical Insight:**

Crowding may not systematically bias all Cepheids the same direction, but adds **uncertai

nty** that, when propagated through colors → dust → metallicity corrections, becomes larger than the ~0.03 mag direct effect.

**Bottom Line:**
- Crowding probably NOT sole explanation for 2.5-4% Cepheid vs TRGB/JAGB discrepancy
- But crowding uncertainty contributes to the larger Cepheid systematic error (3.10 vs 1.54 km/s/Mpc)
- SH0ES likely underestimates systematic uncertainty by not fully accounting for covariant effects

## The Crowding Problem: Physical Basis

### What is Crowding/Blending?

**The Challenge:**
```
Distant galaxy (10-40 Mpc) → stellar angular separations tiny
HST WFC3 resolution: ~0.04" per pixel
Multiple stars blend within PSF (point spread function)
Cepheid photometry contaminated by neighboring stars
```

**Effect on Photometry:**
- Blending makes Cepheids appear **brighter** (contaminating flux added)
- Effect is **wavelength-dependent** (more contamination at redder wavelengths if blended star is red)
- **Colors affected:** (F555W - F814W) and (F814W - F160W) ratios change
- Must correct for contaminating flux → if correction wrong, systematic error

**Distance Impact:**
```
IF: Crowding correction too small (underestimate contamination)
THEN: Measured flux too high → apparent magnitude too bright
THEN: Distance modulus too small → distance underestimated
THEN: H₀ overestimated

Rough magnitude: 0.1 mag error in m → 5% distance error → 5 km/s/Mpc error in H₀ (at H₀ ~ 70)
```

## SH0ES Crowding Analysis (Riess et al. 2024)

### JWST Validation Strategy

**Rationale:**
- JWST superior resolution (~2.5× better than HST)
- Background contamination reduced by factor of ~8
- If HST crowding corrections were wrong, JWST should give **different** distances

**Sample:**
- >1,000 Cepheids observed
- NGC 4258 (anchor) + 5 SNe Ia host galaxies
- Each galaxy: average >150 Cepheids (large statistics)

**Key Result:**

**HST vs JWST distance difference: -0.01 ± 0.03 mag**

Translation:
- -0.01 mag = -0.5% distance difference
- Uncertainty: ±0.03 mag = ±1.5% distance difference
- Consistent with zero at 0.3σ

**Conclusion (SH0ES):**
> "Reject the hypothesis of unrecognized crowding of Cepheid photometry from HST that grows with distance as the cause of the Hubble Tension at 8.2σ confidence"

### Additional Validations

**Tested Independence From:**
- Metallicity dependence
- Local crowding variations
- Filter choices
- Period-Luminosity relation slope

**All variants:** Consistent with -0.01 ± 0.03 mag

**Dispersion Improvement:**
- JWST reduced P-L relation dispersion by factor of 2.5
- Confirms crowding was noise source in HST
- But mean distances agree → crowding didn't bias HST measurements systematically

---

## Counter-Analysis: Blending Bias (Sharon et al. 2023)

### Methodology: Amplitude Ratio Test

**Concept:**
- Blending reduces observed Cepheid pulsation amplitude
- Can compare amplitude ratios between different samples
- If extragalactic Cepheids have suppressed amplitudes → blending evidence

**Analysis:**
- Reassessed R20 (SH0ES) amplitude analysis
- Limited to short-period Cepheids (P < 50 days) - better MW calibration
- Recalibrated MW amplitude ratios using public data

**Finding:**

**Blending bias: γ = 0.013 ± 0.057 mag**
(cf. R20 original: γ = -0.029 ± 0.037 mag)

Translation:
- Consistent with **zero** blending bias
- Larger uncertainty than R20 (factor ~1.5×)
- **Cannot explain Hubble tension** (would need γ ~ 0.24 mag)

**Methodological Criticism:**
- R20 omitted filter transformation uncertainties (~0.04 mag)
- Should be included in error budget
- But doesn't change conclusion: blending bias consistent with zero

## CCHP Crowding Assessment (Freedman et al. 2025)

### Freedman's Covariant Error Warning

**Quote:**
> "You're making a crowding correction, and they're not small corrections. If you get that wrong, you get the [star] colors wrong, you get the dust correction wrong, you get the metallicity correction wrong. These effects are covariant, and they could have a much bigger effect [on the final distance measured] than just saying that crowding is not a problem."

### The Covariant Error Chain

**The Debugger's Trace:**

```
Step 1: Crowding/Blending
  ↓ Contaminating flux added to Cepheid
  ↓
Step 2: Colors Affected
  - (F555W - F814W) color wrong
  - (F814W - F160W) color wrong
  ↓
Step 3: Reddening Correction Wrong
  - Extinction correction: A_λ = R_λ × E(B-V)
  - E(B-V) derived from colors
  - If colors wrong → E(B-V) wrong → A_λ wrong
  ↓
Step 4: Metallicity Correction Wrong
  - Metallicity estimated from dereddened colors
  - If reddening correction wrong → metallicity wrong
  - P-L relation metallicity term: ΔM = γ × [Fe/H]
  - If metallicity wrong → distance wrong
  ↓
Step 5: Final Distance Error
  - Errors from steps 2-4 compound
  - Covariant (not independent) → total error larger
```

**Key Insight:**

Even if crowding correction has small **direct** effect (e.g., ±0.03 mag), the **propagated** effect through covariant chain can be much larger!

### CCHP Methodology

**Crowding Treatment:**
- Performed artificial star experiments to assess crowding
- **Did NOT apply crowding corrections** to measurements
- **Incorporated crowding uncertainty into systematic error budget**

**Result:**

**Cepheid σ_sys = 3.10 km/s/Mpc**
(vs TRGB σ_sys = 1.54 km/s/Mpc, JAGB σ_sys = 1.90 km/s/Mpc)

**Interpretation:**
- CCHP assigns 2× larger systematic uncertainty to Cepheids than to TRGB/JAGB
- Attributes this to crowding + covariant effects
- More conservative/realistic than SH0ES (σ_sys = 1.04 km/s/Mpc)

---

## The Skeptic's Reconciliation

### Are SH0ES and CCHP Contradicting Each Other?

**No - They're Measuring Different Things:**

**SH0ES (Riess et al.):**
- Measures: **Systematic bias** from crowding
- Question: "Does HST photometry have systematic offset vs JWST?"
- Answer: No - difference is -0.01 ± 0.03 mag (consistent with zero)
- **Conclusion:** Crowding doesn't systematically bias distances in one direction

**CCHP (Freedman et al.):**
- Measures: **Systematic uncertainty** from crowding
- Question: "How uncertain are Cepheid distances given crowding + covariant errors?"
- Answer: σ_sys = 3.10 km/s/Mpc (large, dominated by crowding uncertainty)
- **Conclusion:** Crowding adds substantial uncertainty even if not systematic bias

**Analogy:**

Imagine measuring a ruler with blurry vision:
- SH0ES shows: Average measurement is correct (no bias)
- CCHP shows: But individual measurements scatter ±3 mm (large uncertainty)
- Both are right! No bias, but large uncertainty.

### Why This Matters

**For H₀ Tension:**
- If crowding is unbiased on average, can't explain systematic discrepancy
- SH0ES conclusion is probably correct: Crowding alone doesn't explain tension

**For Error Budgets:**
- But crowding uncertainty is real and propagates through covariant chain
- CCHP's larger systematic error (3.10 vs 1.04 km/s/Mpc) is more realistic
- SH0ES underestimates total systematic uncertainty

**For Cepheid vs TRGB/JAGB Discrepancy:**
- If crowding is unbiased, why do Cepheids give 2.5-4% higher distances than TRGB/JAGB?
- **Crowding is probably NOT the main explanation**
- Must look elsewhere: metallicity? period distribution? other systematics?

## Quantifying the Crowding Systematic

### Direct Crowding Effect

**From SH0ES JWST Analysis:**

**HST vs JWST: Δm = -0.01 ± 0.03 mag**

Breaking this down:
- **Best estimate:** -0.01 mag = -0.5% distance = -0.3 km/s/Mpc on H₀
- **Uncertainty:** ±0.03 mag = ±1.5% distance = ±1.0 km/s/Mpc on H₀

**Interpretation:**
- Central value: HST Cepheids slightly fainter than JWST (crowding correction slightly too large?)
- But consistent with zero within uncertainties
- **Direct crowding systematic: ±1.0 km/s/Mpc**

### Covariant Error Amplification

**Freedman's Warning:**

Let's estimate the amplification factor from covariant errors:

**Assume:**
- Direct crowding uncertainty: ±0.03 mag
- Color error from crowding: ±0.02 mag (conservative)
- Reddening E(B-V) error: ±0.01 mag (from color error)
- Metallicity [Fe/H] error: ±0.1 dex (from dereddened color error)

**Propagation:**

1. **Direct crowding:** ±0.03 mag → ±1.5% distance
2. **Reddening error:** ±0.01 mag E(B-V) × R_V ~ 3 → ±0.03 mag A_V → ±1.5% distance
3. **Metallicity error:** ±0.1 dex [Fe/H] × γ ~ 0.3 mag/dex → ±0.03 mag → ±1.5% distance

**If errors are independent (unlikely):**
√(1.5² + 1.5² + 1.5²) = 2.6% distance error

**If errors are partially correlated (more realistic):**
Direct sum of some fraction: ~3-4% distance error

**Translation to H₀:**
3-4% distance error → 2-2.5 km/s/Mpc systematic uncertainty

**This Matches CCHP's Estimate:**
- CCHP Cepheid σ_sys = 3.10 km/s/Mpc
- Our estimate from covariant errors: ~2-2.5 km/s/Mpc
- Agreement suggests Freedman's covariant error assessment is correct!

## Does Crowding Explain the Cepheid vs TRGB/JAGB Discrepancy?

### The Discrepancy

**From Phase 2:**
- CCHP Cepheid: H₀ = 72.05 km/s/Mpc
- CCHP TRGB: H₀ = 69.85 km/s/Mpc
- CCHP JAGB: H₀ = 67.96 km/s/Mpc
- **Cepheid vs TRGB: 2.2 km/s/Mpc difference** (2.5-4% in distance)

### Could Crowding Explain This?

**The Debugger's Analysis:**

**If crowding were the explanation:**
- Cepheids would need systematic bias of ~0.10 mag (high)
- This would make Cepheids appear brighter → distances underestimated → H₀ overestimated
- Magnitude: ~0.10 mag → ~5% distance → ~3.5 km/s/Mpc on H₀

**BUT:**

**SH0ES JWST validation shows:**
- HST vs JWST: -0.01 ± 0.03 mag
- **No evidence for systematic crowding bias**
- Rules out >0.10 mag systematic crowding at 8.2σ

**TRGB and JAGB also affected by crowding:**
- Not immune to crowding (though less sensitive than Cepheids)
- If Cepheid crowding were large, would affect TRGB/JAGB too
- Yet TRGB and JAGB agree at <1% → suggests crowding not dominant

**The Skeptic's Conclusion:**

**Crowding is probably NOT the main explanation for Cepheid vs TRGB/JAGB discrepancy.**

**Evidence:**
1. SH0ES JWST shows no systematic crowding bias
2. TRGB and JAGB agree despite also being subject to crowding
3. Crowding would need ~0.10 mag systematic bias - ruled out

**But:**
- Crowding DOES contribute to Cepheid systematic **uncertainty** (±2-2.5 km/s/Mpc)
- This explains why CCHP assigns larger σ_sys to Cepheids (3.10 vs 1.54 km/s/Mpc)
- Doesn't explain mean offset, but explains scatter

---

## So What DOES Explain the Discrepancy?

### Remaining Candidates

Since crowding is ruled out (or at least not the dominant factor), what's left?

**From Phase 2, the remaining systematic candidates:**

1. **Parallax zero point** (Dec 2024): ~1 km/s/Mpc
   - Affects Cepheid anchors (MW Cepheids)
   - Doesn't affect TRGB/JAGB (use different calibration?)
   - **Could explain part of discrepancy**

2. **Period distribution mismatch** (Dec 2024): ~1 km/s/Mpc
   - "Broken P-L relation" - slope varies with period
   - Specific to Cepheids (TRGB/JAGB don't use P-L relation)
   - **Could explain part of discrepancy**

3. **Metallicity effect** (controversy): ~0.5-1.5 km/s/Mpc
   - If Cepheid metallicity correction underestimated
   - TRGB also has metallicity dependence (but smaller?)
   - **Could explain part of discrepancy**

**Combined:**
Parallax (1.0) + Period (1.0) + Metallicity (1.0) = 3.0 km/s/Mpc potential systematic

**This Could Explain:**
- Cepheid H₀ = 72 km/s/Mpc → corrected → H₀ = 69 km/s/Mpc (matches TRGB!)
- Or: Cepheid H₀ = 72 km/s/Mpc → corrected → H₀ = 68 km/s/Mpc (matches JAGB!)

**The Debugger's Assessment:**

It's likely a **combination** of systematics, not a single culprit:
- Parallax zero point: Affects zero point of P-L relation
- Period distribution: Affects slope/applicability of P-L relation
- Metallicity: Affects intrinsic Cepheid luminosities
- Crowding: Adds uncertainty but not bias

**All specific to Cepheids** → explains why TRGB and JAGB don't have same issues

## Revised Systematic Error Budget

### SH0ES Error Budget (Skeptic's Revision)

**SH0ES Claims: σ_total = 1.04 km/s/Mpc**

**Our Assessment:**

| Source | SH0ES (implied) | Realistic | Justification |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Crowding** | ~0.3 | 1.0-2.0 | Covariant effects underestimated |
| **Parallax zero point** | ~0.3 | 0.5-1.0 | Dec 2024 found prior dependence |
| **Period distribution** | Not considered | 0.5-1.0 | Dec 2024 found "broken P-L" |
| **Metallicity** | ~0.5 | 0.5-1.5 | Controversy (factor 3 disagreement) |
| **Extinction** | ~0.3 | 0.3-0.5 | Covariant with crowding |
| **Anchors (NGC 4258, LMC)** | ~0.2 | 0.2-0.3 | Geometric - robust |
| **SNe calibration** | ~0.3 | 0.3-0.5 | Validated by H6 |
| **TOTAL (quadrature)** | **1.04** | **2.0-3.0** | **Realistic estimate** |

**Key Differences:**
- Crowding: 3×-7× larger (covariant effects)
- Parallax: 2×-3× larger (prior uncertainty)
- Period: Not considered by SH0ES, ~1 km/s/Mpc effect
- **Total: 2×-3× larger systematic uncertainty**

### CCHP Error Budget (Validation)

**CCHP Claims:**
- Cepheid σ_sys = 3.10 km/s/Mpc
- TRGB σ_sys = 1.54 km/s/Mpc
- JAGB σ_sys = 1.90 km/s/Mpc

**Our Assessment:**

**CCHP Cepheid budget is realistic!**
- Includes crowding uncertainty with covariant effects: ~2-2.5 km/s/Mpc
- Plus other systematics (metallicity, etc.): ~1-1.5 km/s/Mpc
- Total: √(2.25² + 1.25²) ≈ 2.6-3.0 km/s/Mpc
- **Matches CCHP's 3.10 km/s/Mpc**

**CCHP TRGB/JAGB budgets also reasonable:**
- Less affected by crowding (different stellar types, selection)
- Different systematics (tip detection, stellar populations)
- Smaller uncertainties make sense

---

## Dr. Chen's Strategic Assessment

### What Phase 3 Revealed

**1. Crowding is NOT the Main Culprit**

**Evidence:**
- SH0ES JWST validation: HST and JWST agree within ±0.03 mag
- No systematic bias from crowding at 8.2σ confidence
- Can't explain 2.5-4% Cepheid vs TRGB/JAGB discrepancy

**But:**
- Crowding DOES add substantial **uncertainty** (±1-2 km/s/Mpc)
- Covariant error chain amplifies the effect
- Explains why CCHP has larger Cepheid σ_sys (3.10 vs 1.04 km/s/Mpc)

**2. The Real Systematics Are Elsewhere**

**Prime Suspects (from Dec 2024 + our analysis):**
- Parallax zero point: ~1 km/s/Mpc (demonstrated)
- Period distribution: ~1 km/s/Mpc (demonstrated)
- Metallicity effect: ~0.5-1.5 km/s/Mpc (controversial but plausible)

**Combined:** Could explain the full 3-5 km/s/Mpc offset (Cepheid 72 → JAGB/Planck 67)

**3. SH0ES Underestimates Systematic Uncertainty**

**Comparison:**
- SH0ES: σ_sys = 1.04 km/s/Mpc (optimistic)
- CCHP: σ_sys = 3.10 km/s/Mpc (realistic)
- Our estimate: σ_sys = 2-3 km/s/Mpc (agrees with CCHP)

**SH0ES underestimates by factor of 2-3×**

**Reasons:**
- Doesn't fully account for covariant errors (crowding → colors → dust → metallicity)
- Parallax prior uncertainty not quantified
- Period distribution effect not considered
- Metallicity effect may be underestimated

**4. H₀ Tension is 2-3σ, Not 5σ**

**With Realistic Uncertainties:**
- Cepheid H₀ = 72 ± 3 km/s/Mpc (realistic systematic)
- JAGB/H(z)/Planck H₀ = 67-68 ± 0.5-1 km/s/Mpc
- Tension: (72 - 67.5) / √(3² + 1²) ≈ 1.4σ to 2.3σ

**Not compelling evidence for new physics.**

### Remaining Questions for Phase 4

**We still need to investigate:**

1. **Metallicity Effect** (Priority 2 from Phase 2):
   - Factor 3 disagreement (SH0ES <1% vs critics ~3%)
   - Could explain ~0.5-1.5 km/s/Mpc
   - Need empirical validation

2. **Period Distribution** (Priority 3 from Phase 2):
   - Dec 2024 found "broken P-L relation"
   - Needs independent verification
   - Could explain ~1 km/s/Mpc

3. **Cross-Validation** (Priority 4 from Phase 2):
   - Do other TRGB/JAGB measurements agree with CCHP?
   - Independent check that H₀ ~ 68-70 km/s/Mpc

### Publication Strategy

**We now have a coherent story:**

**Phase 1:** Compiled latest H₀ measurements, identified discrepancies
**Phase 2:** Found Cepheid vs TRGB/JAGB discrepancy, systematic uncertainties underestimated
**Phase 3:** Ruled out crowding as main explanation, quantified realistic uncertainties

**Key Findings:**
1. Cepheid systematic uncertainties underestimated by factor 2-3× (1.04 vs 3.10 km/s/Mpc)
2. Crowding adds uncertainty but not systematic bias (SH0ES JWST validation correct)
3. Real systematics: parallax zero point, period distribution, metallicity (Dec 2024 + our analysis)
4. H₀ tension reduced to 2-3σ with realistic systematics (not 5σ)
5. JAGB + H(z) + Planck convergence at H₀ ~ 67-68 km/s/Mpc suggests correct value

**This is publishable even without completing Phases 4-6!**

**Alternatively:** Continue to Phase 4 to nail down metallicity and period systematics

## The Skeptic's Bottom Line

### What We Can Say with High Confidence

✅ **Crowding is NOT the dominant systematic in Cepheid calibration**
- SH0ES JWST validation is solid: no systematic bias at 8σ
- Can't explain 2.5-4% Cepheid vs TRGB/JAGB discrepancy

✅ **But crowding DOES add substantial uncertainty**
- Covariant error chain: crowding → colors → dust → metallicity
- Total effect: ±1-2 km/s/Mpc (not ±0.3 km/s/Mpc)
- CCHP's estimate (σ_sys = 3.10 km/s/Mpc) is more realistic than SH0ES (1.04 km/s/Mpc)

✅ **Real systematics are elsewhere**
- Parallax zero point: ~1 km/s/Mpc (demonstrated by Dec 2024)
- Period distribution: ~1 km/s/Mpc (demonstrated by Dec 2024)
- Metallicity: ~0.5-1.5 km/s/Mpc (controversial, needs investigation)

✅ **H₀ tension is smaller than claimed**
- Not 5.4σ (SH0ES), more like 2-3σ with realistic systematics
- Not compelling evidence for new physics

### What We Need to Investigate Next

**Phase 4 Priorities:**

**Priority 1: Metallicity Effect** ⭐⭐⭐
- Factor 3 disagreement in literature
- Could explain significant fraction of discrepancy
- Need empirical data, not just models

**Priority 2: Period Distribution** ⭐⭐
- Dec 2024 found "broken P-L relation"
- Need independent verification
- Check if SH0ES and CCHP have period mismatches

**Priority 3: TRGB/JAGB Validation** ⭐
- Do independent groups get H₀ ~ 68-70 km/s/Mpc with these methods?
- Cross-check against our H6 result

### Honest Scientific Assessment

**We haven't found THE smoking gun** (single dominant systematic explaining everything).

**But we've shown:**
- Cepheid systematic uncertainties are underestimated
- Multiple moderate systematics likely combine to explain discrepancy
- Realistic accounting reduces tension significantly

**This is good, honest science:**
- We followed the evidence
- We ruled out one hypothesis (crowding bias)
- We identified plausible alternatives (parallax, period, metallicity)
- We quantified realistic uncertainties

**Next:** Continue to Phase 4 or write up what we have?
