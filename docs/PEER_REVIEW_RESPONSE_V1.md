## Executive Summary

**Reviewer Assessment:** ðŸŸ¢ Positive - "Solid foundation" with no technical content critiques

**Key Feedback Pattern:** All 8 categories of feedback request **presentation enhancements** (accessibility, impact statements, implications) rather than scientific corrections.

**Response Strategy:** Implemented 4 immediate Week 1 enhancements, deferred 4 Week 2 additions to Results/Discussion/Conclusions writing phase.

**Outcome:** Manuscript v1.1 with improved accessibility and impact clarity while maintaining technical rigor.

## Detailed Response to Feedback

### 1. Abstract âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**

**Reviewer Feedback:**
> "Include a brief sentence about the broader implications for the field of cosmology in guiding future studies or fund allocations."

**Response:** ACCEPTED - Enhanced conclusion sentence

**Action Taken:**
- **Location:** Abstract final sentence (line 42)
- **Original:** "The Hubble tension is likely a measurement artifact, not evidence for new physics."
- **Enhanced:** "The Hubble tension is likely a measurement artifact, not evidence for new physics, redirecting observational efforts toward distance measurement precision rather than exotic physics searches."
- **Impact:** +13 words (249â†’262 words, within editorial tolerance)

**Rationale:** Directly addresses reviewer's request for resource allocation implications while maintaining conciseness.

---

### 2. Introduction âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**

**Reviewer Feedback (Part 1):**
> "Expand on why reducing the tension from 6Ïƒ to 1Ïƒ is crucial, perhaps exploring its significance beyond resolving the current academic debate."

**Response:** ACCEPTED - Added significance paragraph

**Action Taken:**
- **Location:** Introduction Â§1.2, after investment discussion (new paragraph at line 69)
- **Addition:**
  > "Conversely, demonstrating that the tension can be reduced from 5-6Ïƒ to ~1Ïƒ through realistic systematic uncertainties fundamentally shifts the scientific narrative. Rather than demanding revolutionary new physics, the data would become consistent with improved measurement precision within the standard Î›CDM cosmological model. This redirection has profound implications for resource allocation: billions of dollars in observational programs currently targeting exotic physics explanations could be more productively invested in refining standard distance ladder techniques and addressing known systematic uncertainties."
- **Impact:** +65 words, strengthens motivation

**Rationale:** Explicitly articulates why the 6Ïƒâ†’1Ïƒ reduction matters beyond academic interest - it redirects billions in research investment.

**Reviewer Feedback (Part 2):**
> "Simplifying [historical background] for quick accessibility could benefit entry-level readers or researchers skimming the initial content."

**Response:** DEFERRED - Current level appropriate for ApJ audience

**Rationale:**
- ApJ targets specialist cosmology audience, not general readership
- Historical context (Hubble 1929 â†’ HST Key Project â†’ precision era) is already concise (~3 sentences)
- Entry-level accessibility would compromise technical depth expected by reviewers
- Introduction Â§1.1 is already well-received by peer reviewers

---

### 3. Methodology âœ… **IMPLEMENTED (2/2 suggestions)**

**Reviewer Feedback (Part 1):**
> "Emphasizing why multiple validation strategies are necessary could strengthen this section. Highlight how each method addresses different potential weaknesses."

**Response:** ACCEPTED - Enhanced validation justification

**Action Taken:**
- **Location:** Methods Â§2 introduction paragraph (line 117)
- **Original:** "These strategies are intentionally diverse in their approach---spanning error budget reconstruction, cross-validation with alternative distance indicators, model-independent Hâ‚€ constraints, and tension evolution analysis---to ensure robustness against any single methodology's limitations."
- **Enhanced:** Added two sentences:
  > "By requiring consistency across fundamentally different validation approaches, we minimize the risk of methodology-dependent biases affecting our conclusions. Each strategy addresses distinct potential weaknesses: error budget reconstruction tests claimed uncertainties, cross-validation reveals inter-method systematics, cosmic chronometers bypass the distance ladder entirely, and tension evolution quantifies the cumulative impact of realistic uncertainties."
- **Impact:** +60 words, explicit strategy justification

**Rationale:** Makes validation strategy logic transparent and defensible against methodology critiques.

**Reviewer Feedback (Part 2):**
> "Briefly explain your repository's structure to facilitate other researchers' access and usage."

**Response:** ACCEPTED - Added repository details

**Action Taken:**
- **Location:** Methods Â§2 introduction, after repository URL mention (line 115)
- **Original:** "Our code and data are publicly available at [repository URL] to enable independent verification."
- **Enhanced:** "Our code and data are publicly available at [repository URL] to enable independent verification. The repository includes data provenance documentation, validation tests against published results, and step-by-step Jupyter notebooks that reproduce all figures and tables in this manuscript."
- **Impact:** +25 words, improved reproducibility transparency

**Rationale:** Addresses open science best practices and facilitates independent verification.

**Reviewer Feedback (Part 2):**
> "Clarify why these specific systematics were chosen or if others were excluded, to transparently communicate decision-making."

**Response:** ACCEPTED - Will enhance systematic selection transparency

**Action Plan:**
- Results Â§3.1 will include paragraph explaining 11-source selection criterion (>0.5% distance effect)
