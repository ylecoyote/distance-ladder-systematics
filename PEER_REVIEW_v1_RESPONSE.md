## Critical Issues - Verification & Fix Plan

### ✅ Issue A1: Equation (6) - Statistical term in systematic uncertainty

**Reviewer's finding**:
> "Eq. (6): statistical term mistakenly included. You label Eq. (6) as σ_sys yet the summation includes the 0.8 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹ statistical uncertainty."

**Current equation (line 248-250)**:
```latex
\sigma_{\rm sys} = \sqrt{1.0^2 + 1.0^2 + 1.0^2 + 0.3^2 + 1.5^2 + 0.3^2 + 0.5^2 + 0.2^2 + 0.2^2 + 0.5^2 + 0.8^2} = 2.45
```

**Problem**:
- Equation includes `0.8²` (statistical term from row 12 of CSV)
- But labeled as `σ_sys` (systematic only)
- WITH 0.8²: √6.65 = **2.579** (doesn't match printed 2.45)
- WITHOUT 0.8²: √6.01 = **2.45** ✓ (matches printed value)

**Verdict**: The **value 2.45 is correct**, but the **equation must remove 0.8²**

**Fix**:
```latex
\sigma_{\rm sys} = \sqrt{1.0^2 + 1.0^2 + 1.0^2 + 0.3^2 + 1.5^2 + 0.3^2 + 0.5^2 + 0.2^2 + 0.2^2 + 0.5^2} = 2.45~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}
```

**Location**: [manuscript.tex:248-250](manuscript/manuscript.tex#L248-L250)

**Impact**: Low - value is already correct, only equation display needs fix

### ✅ Issue A2: Stage-5 σ_total arithmetic error

**Reviewer's finding**:
> "Stage-5 σ_total arithmetic. You write σ_total = √(0.80² + 2.45²) = 2.43. Numerically √(0.64 + 6.0025) ≈ 2.58, not 2.43."

**Current (line 273)**:
```latex
\sigma_{\rm total} = \sqrt{0.80^2 + 2.45^2} = 2.43~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}
```

**Verification**:
```
σ_total = √(0.80² + 2.45²)
        = √(0.64 + 6.0025)
        = √6.6425
        = 2.577 ≈ 2.58 km/s/Mpc
```

**Printed value**: 2.43 ❌
**Correct value**: 2.58 ✓

**Fix**:
```latex
\sigma_{\rm total} = \sqrt{0.80^2 + 2.45^2} = 2.58~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}
```

**Location**: [manuscript.tex:273](manuscript/manuscript.tex#L273)

**Impact on main result**: **NONE** - tension calculation is still 1.1σ:
```
Tension = 2.81 / √(2.58² + 0.54²) = 2.81 / 2.636 = 1.066σ ≈ 1.1σ ✓
```

**Required propagation**:
- Line 273: H₀ error bar (2.43 → 2.58)
- Table 2 Stage-5 σ_total column
- Equation (7) context text

---

### 📋 Issue B: Stage numbering mismatch

**Reviewer's finding**:
> "Methodology (§2.4) lists six stages; Results (§3.2) & Figure 1 show five. Please align."

**Verification needed**:
- §2.4 (lines 201-215): Lists **6 enumerated items**
  1. Baseline (statistical only)
  2. + SH0ES systematics
  3. + Realistic systematics
  4. + Parallax correction
  5. + Period correction
  6. + Metallicity correction

- §3.2 Results text: Describes **5 stages**
  - Stage 1: Baseline
  - Stage 2: + SH0ES sys
  - Stage 3: + Parallax
  - Stage 4: + Period
  - Stage 5: + Metallicity + realistic sys

**Issue**: Stage 3 "Realistic systematics" in Methods is **folded into Stage 5** in Results

**Resolution options**:
1. **Option A** (cleaner): Use 5 stages throughout, fold "realistic sys" into final stage
2. **Option B** (more detailed): Use 6 stages throughout, separate "realistic sys" step

**Recommendation**: Option A (5 stages) - matches Table 2, simpler narrative

**Required changes**:
- §2.4: Remove item 3 as separate stage, incorporate into item 6
- Figure 1: Verify shows 5 stages
- Table 2: Already shows 5 stages ✓

### 📊 Issue C1: TRGB-JAGB sample size mismatch

**Reviewer's finding**:
> "You state 8 TRGB–JAGB galaxies when outlining the data (§2.2) but use 7 in the results/summary (Figure 3 & Table 4)."

**Locations to check**:
- Line 163: "8 galaxies with both JWST TRGB and JAGB distance moduli"
- Figure 3 caption
- Table 4 sample count

**Action required**: Verify actual data, reconcile counts

---

### 📊 Issue C2: χ²_red inconsistency for H(z)

**Reviewer's finding**:
> "§3.3 text reports χ²_red = 0.95 for 31 dof, while Figure 5 caption quotes 0.47."

**Action required**:
- Check H(z) fit output file
- Verify correct value
- Update text or figure caption

---

### 🔬 Issue D: Ωₘ prior reduces H(z) independence

**Reviewer's finding**:
> "The H(z) measurements are model-independent, but extrapolating to H₀ with flat ΛCDM while fixing Ωₘ = 0.315 (Planck) introduces a Planck prior and reduces independence."

**Current approach** (line 189):
```latex
with fixed matter density $\Omega_m = 0.315$ from \textit{Planck}
```

**Requested additions**:
1. Fit marginalizing over Ωₘ with weak prior
2. Show sensitivity: ΔH₀ for Ωₘ ∈ [0.25, 0.35]
3. Discuss impact on three-method convergence weight

**Action required**: New analysis + paragraph

---

### 📐 Issue E: Significance reporting asymmetry

**Reviewer's finding**:
> "In §3.3 you state corrected Cepheid H₀ = 70.17 is 5.4σ above the 67.48 ± 0.50 'convergence' value—apparently using only the 0.50 error bar and ignoring the Cepheid uncertainty."

**Issue**: Inconsistent σ definitions
- Equation (5): Uses combined uncertainties ✓
- §3.3 text: Uses only convergence error bar (0.50) ❌

**Fix**: Always use combined uncertainties:
```
Offset = (70.17 - 67.48) = 2.69 km/s/Mpc
Combined σ = √(2.58² + 0.50²) = √(6.6564 + 0.25) = 2.63
Tension = 2.69 / 2.63 = 1.02σ ≈ 1.0σ
```

**Location**: Find "5.4σ" reference in §3.3

### 🔗 Issue F: Covariance in systematic budget

**Reviewer's finding**:
> "You sum the 11 systematic sources in quadrature assuming independence (Eq. 1), but you also argue covariant pathways (e.g., crowding→colors→extinction→metallicity)."

**Requested additions**:
1. Discuss covariance assumption and justification
2. Sensitivity analysis with ρ ≳ 0.3 among {metallicity, reddening, crowding}
3. Report shift in σ_sys and Stage-5 tension

**Action required**: New analysis section + Monte Carlo or analytic bounds

---

## Bottom Line

**Reviewer's assessment**: ✅ "Your core story is compelling and—once the bookkeeping and independence caveats are tightened—publishable."

**Our response**: We agree with all critiques. The errors are **fixable consistency issues**, not fundamental flaws. The main conclusions (1.1σ tension, H₀ ≈ 67-68 km/s/Mpc convergence) **remain valid** after corrections.

**Next step**: Systematic fixes in order of priority (arithmetic → analysis → presentation)
